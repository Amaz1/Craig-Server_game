Rubber mod for Minetest

Forked from PilzAdam's farming_plus mod, relicensed under GPL.

Install the mod as normal, and use buckets on rubber trees (which are
generated rarely in nature) to get rubber. Chopping down a rubber tree
will give you rubber saplings from the leaves.

See COPYING for more information on the licensing.
